    <h2>💡 Financial Tips</h2>
    <ul id="tipsList">
      <li>
        <strong>Track Your Spending:</strong> Know where every cedi goes. Use budgeting apps or spreadsheets to avoid impulse buying.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Create a Weekly Budget:</strong> Plan your weekly allowance and stick to it. Set aside amounts for food, transportation, and savings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Follow the 50/30/20 Rule:</strong> Spend 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and save 20% if possible. Adjust percentages based on your situation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Start Saving Early:</strong> Even GHS 2 a day adds up. Create a goal (e.g. “Save GHS 50 in 1 month”) and reward yourself when you succeed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Avoid Unnecessary Debt:</strong> Borrow only when necessary and understand repayment terms. Avoid "buy now, pay later" traps.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make Informed Decisions:</strong> Before making any purchase or investment, ask yourself: “Do I need this?” and “Is this the best deal?”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Learn to Compare Prices:</strong> Don’t just buy the first option. Use online stores or visit different vendors to find better prices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Build an Emergency Fund:</strong> Set aside a small portion each week for unexpected needs. This builds financial confidence and reduces stress.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practice Delayed Gratification:</strong> Wait a few days before making non-essential purchases. Often, the desire passes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Review Weekly:</strong> Take 5 minutes every weekend to review what you spent, what you saved, and what needs to improve.
      </li>
    </ul>
